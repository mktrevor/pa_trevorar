# Design Document for PA1

## Purpose/Overview
> Give a brief, high-level description of what this piece of software will do. This is pretty much you restating the problem as you understand it.


## Requirements
> What are the functions that this software is supposed to perform?
> Try to phrase them in a clear and concise manner.


## Classes
> What classes do you need to create?
> + Describe the purpose of each class.
> + What member data will they have? Why?
> + What methods will they have? Why?
> Make sure you describe each member variable and member function.


## Global Data/Functions
> What global data & functions do you have? Describe any pieces of your program that are not within a class. You don't need to describe every single variable you use, but are there any global variables or functions that are integral to how your program works?

## High-level Architecture
> What is the high level flow of data through your program? How will all of your objects interact? What are the algorithms that your code will use?

> You will spend a lot of time describing in detail all the objects and functions that you'll use, but you need to talk a bit about how they all fit together.


## User Interface
> Describe how the user will interact with your software.

> If you have a GUI, how will it be laid out (provide a sketch if possible)?
> + Where will buttons and other controls be located?
> + Describe how the user will interact with it.

> If you don't have a GUI, what kind of interaction will the user have?
> + What data will the user enter?
> + How will they enter it?


##Test Cases
> + How do you plan on testing your system?
> + What are the potential problem cases?
> + What are some nominal test cases?
> + For each function, describe some possible tests (what data would you pass in? What results do you expect?)
